# Martian-photos https://mars-photos.web.app/
 <h1> Web app for viewing photos from Martian missions based on NASA`s API</h3>
 <p>For starting this project on you PC you need to download actual version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js</a>. You can do it from official web-site. </p>
 <p>Then you need to install npm modules in storage with project using <code> npm install</code>  in Terminal. You also need to install SASS preprocessor from npm modules using  <code> npm install node-sass </code>  in Terminal. After installing all modules, you need to start project using <code> npm start</code>  in Terminal.</p>
 <p> In development mode, the development server from <code> create-react-app</code>  runs in the background automatically, so your client-side resources are dynamically built on  demand and the page refreshes when you modify any file.</p>
 <p>In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and your <code> npm run build</code>  configuration produces minified, efficiently bundled React project.</p>
