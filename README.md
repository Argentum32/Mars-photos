 For starting this project on you PC you need to download actual version of Node.js. You can do it from official web-site. 
 Then you need to install npm modules in storage with project using <code> npm install </code> in Terminal. You also need to install SASS preprocessor from npm modules using <code> npm install node-sass </code> in Terminal. After installing all modules, you need to start project using <code> npm start </code> in Terminal.
 In development mode, the development server from <code> create-react-app </code> runs in the background automatically, so your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand and the page refreshes when you modify any file.
 In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and your <code> npm run build </code> configuration produces minified, efficiently bundled React project.
